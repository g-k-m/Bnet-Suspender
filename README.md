# Bnet-Suspender

Upon launch creates an invisible icon in the tray area, you can still see it if you hover over it, this is done to avoid duplication of icons

Upon left clicking of the icon it suspends all Agent.exe and Battle.net.exe processes, you should see "Success" pop-up
Upon right click of the icon it resumes all Agent.exe and Battle.net.exe processes, and opens bnet to save u time on double clicking the real bnet icon
Only works if bnet is installed in the default location "C:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net\Battle.net.exe"
