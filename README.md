# Bnet-Suspender

Creates an invisible icon in the tray area, you can see it if you hover over it  

Upon left clicking of the icon it suspends all Agent.exe and Battle.net.exe processes, sometimes it even shows a "Success" pop-up  
Upon right clicking of the icon it resumes all Agent.exe and Battle.net.exe processes, and opens bnet to save u time on double clicking the real icon  
Only works if bnet is installed in the default location "C:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net\Battle.net.exe"  

Upsides: prevents cpu drain in the background without having to exit bnet (on my cpu about 0.5%)  
Downsides: no notifications when someone comes online, goes offline, messages you etc.
